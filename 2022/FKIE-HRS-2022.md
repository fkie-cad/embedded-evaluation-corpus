# FKIE-HRS-2022

The FKIE-HRS-2022 corpus provides samples of home routers from 'big' vendors selling their products in Europe.
The corpus was created on March 31st 2022.
It provides the latest stable firmware versions of all routers that were promoted on the vendor's websites at that date.
If there was more then one hardware revision of a router, we took the firmware of the most recent hardware revision.
There are some routers missing, because their firmware was not provided on the vendor's website or ftp server.
